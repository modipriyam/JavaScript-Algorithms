##Desciption : 
The assignment is about creating the a Binary Search Algorithm, Quick Sort and Reverse a String.

##Binary Search Algorithm : 
It cointains a function which takes a data in an array and element to find as a parameter. 
After getting the data in array it will calculate its length and then it will divide it into 2 parts start and stop point.
If the element to be search is greater than then the middle element it search in the right side.
If the element to be search is less than then the middle element it search in the left side of the array.
It will update the postion in the variable Middle.
And it will Print the Postion of the element that was searched.

##Math.Floor :
Function will convert the decimal number to the nearest whole integer.

##QuickSort : 
It cointains three function in total, 1st Quicksort function which will sort the array it cointains two sub functions, Shuffle and partvalues.
Shuffle function will the shuffle the position according to the value of the data. and the Partvalues function is working as the pointer. It will find the middle element and make it pivot. It the next element encounter is greater than pivot it shuffle the postion using the Shuffle Function.

##StringReverse : 
String Reverse function will reverse the inserted string using the popout property of array.
